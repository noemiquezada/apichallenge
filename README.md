# Code 2040 API Challenge
This is my AngularJS solution to the Code 2040 API Challenge 2015-2016. 
## Challenge
The API Challenge consisted of four stages: 
1. Reverse a String - self explanatory
2. Needle in a haystack - Find the position of the needle (strings) in the haystack (array of strings)
3. Prefix - Find all strings that do not start with a prefix
4. The Dating Game - Given a datestamp in ISO 8601 format  and interval (number of seconds) give the new datestamp.
## My Approach
